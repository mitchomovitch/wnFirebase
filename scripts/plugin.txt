npm install firebase --save

NOTE ON RC1: Usually the types ecosystem is strong and all you need to do is go npm install @types/package_name to get it working, but Firebase hasn’t updated their type definition to 3.x and they’re still using 2.4.x that’s for the old console.

So you’ll need to do a little hack to get this to work, I hope to remove this section soon
